<h1> My name is Alex Blank, and I am a junior studying communication arts with a minor in digital media studies. I am from
Waukesha Wisconsin. </h1>

<p> I like to play volleyball, snow-ski, waterski, anything that involves the outdoors! Summer is my favorite season, as I 
love the warm weather and being on the lake. </p>
